*** TODO [#A] Confirm before kill scratch buffer
Customize ~kill-buffer-hook~.
*** TODO [#B] multi-vterm: dedicated window
*** TODO [#B] Disable mouse wheel
It's too annoying with my magical mouse.

On the tab:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(keymap-global-unset "<tab-bar> <wheel-up>" t)
(keymap-global-unset "<tab-bar> <wheel-down>" t)
#+end_src
*** TODO [#C] Special fonts in =*Messages*= buffer
*** TODO [#C] Is it necessary to specify fringe?
See [[elisp:(info "(elisp) Fringe Size/Pos")][manual]]. Related variables: ~{left,right}-fringe-width~, ~default-frame-alist~.
*** DOING [#A] Always backup input when ~C-c C-c~ in ~forge-create-pullreq~
*** DOING [#A] ~whitespace-cleanup-mode~: do not clean newlines in the end
- [X] Implement in ~whitespace-cleanup-mode-write-file~
- [ ] Send a PR?
*** CANCELED [#B] It would be better if ~consult-buffer~'s posframe could be lower in the screen
2024-05-14: cancel. I do not use vertico-posframe anymore.
- [ ] ~consult-buffer~: lower
- [ ] ~yank-pop~ and ~consult-yank-pop~: even lower
*** DONE [#A] Upcase the region in ~upcase-previous-word~
*** DONE [#A] Rewrite ~celeste/sis-mode~
- ~sis-global-respect-mode~ should be buffer-local, since it overrides some
  prefix key, which conflicts with embark.

It's difficult to do that. So I write a convenient wrapper for sis, ~celeste/sis-mode~.

*** DONE [#A] Enable auto ~whitespace-cleanup~ for YAML file
*** DONE [#A] Disable bindings for ~C-<wheel-up>~ in OSX
My magical mouse is to sensitive.
*** DONE [#A] Enable more consult extensions like ~consult-info~
*** DONE [#A] customize ~org-ellipsis~
*** DONE [#A] bind ~multi-vterm~
*** DONE [#A] rename ~+org-kill-this-link~
Should be something like ~+org-cut-this-link~
*** DONE [#B] Write a function to insert info page as org-link
*** DONE [#B] Should I write a function like "always-save"?
I add it.
*** DONE [#B] Add warning facility for ~celeste/prepare-package~
*** DONE [#B] Embark and helpful integration
*** DONE [#B] Remove ~diff-hl-\*~ bindings. They are useless and buggy. Just use Magit.

2024-05-15: not as helpful as I think it would be.
*** CANCELED [#B] [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][leuven]]: Best org-mode theme?
Average.
*** CANCELED [#C] Maybe it's time to try another theme
Candidates: [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs.git][tao-theme]] [[https://github.com/maio/eink-emacs][elink]]
Maintaining the theme by myself is difficult for me. I do not understand what a
theme does under the hood. It may be better to begin with other people's work.

Doom's themes are too magical. My theme is based on doom-themes but I really
want to separate it out.

2024-05-12: I'm not satisfied with those themes. Maybe I still need to customize
my own theme. But I need to get rid of doom-themes. See [[*Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes][Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes]].
*** DONE [#A] new auto-save facility
Fork [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/auto-save][lazycat's auto-save]]
*** DONE [#A] shellcheck integration
Already integrated by flycheck.
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]], [[https://github.com/Ladicle/hydra-posframe][hydra-posframe]], [[https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el][pretty-hydra]]
2024-05-13: Hydra is added. I may not use pretty-hydra or hydra-posframe. I want
to keep my hydra configuration simple enough: it should not conquer my key
binding system - it should just be a kind of sugar that brings some facilities
to me.

- [X] org-mode navigation hydra. Better than ~org-speed-command~.
- [X] add more navigation commands in hydra-vi. Ref: [[file:packages/hydra/hydra-examples.el::defhydra hydra-vi (:pre hydra-vi/pre :post hydra-vi/post :color amaranth][hydra-example.el: hydra-vi]]
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/mickeynp/ligature.el][ligature.el]]
[[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/unicode-ligatures-color-emoji][Unicode, Ligatures and Color Emoji - Mastering Emacs]]
*** DONE [#A] Add ~project-vterm~ to project's shortcut
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/tecosaur/org-pandoc-import][org-pandoc-import]]: how did you come with that
It's Okay, but I would prefer to use it just as the a pandoc frontend. The
~org-pandoc-import-transient-mode~ seems to be buggy for me.
*** DONE [#A] org-mode (use the newest version)
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/gcmh][gcmh]]: GC magic hack
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/casouri/vundo][vundo]]

Currently OK, with osx-dictionary.
*** DONE [#B] protect ~tab-bar-close-tab~
It's easy to be mispressed.
- [X] remove the binding
- [X] add confirmation mechanism
- [X] restore the binding

*** TODO [#A] Write scripts to compile packages
Some packages can be compiled into byte-code. Docs can be installed too.
*** TODO [#B] Try to report the "bug" of ~kill-whole-line~
To report a bug of Emacs, use ~report-emacs-bug~ and send an Email. Before that,
I want to set the Email client in Emacs, and subscribe Emacs's mailing list.
*** TODO [#B] Improve [[file:lisp/init-org.el::defun +org-sort-todo-with-priority (][+org-sort-todo-with-priority]]
Specify the order, e.g. the priority of DOING should be over TODO.
*** TODO [#B] ~consult-locate~ for OSX
OSX use ~mdfind~ for locate command. It behaves differently from locate.
I may need something like:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq consult-locate-args "mdfind-wrapper -name ARG OPTS")
#+end_src
*** TODO [#C] Better (or more suitable for me) LSP client?
- [ ] Reddit thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1c0v28k/lspmode_vs_lspbridge_vs_lspce_vs_eglot/][I used all the LSP thingies so you don't have to.]]
*** TODO [#C] Manage byte compiler
Some packages like org-roam contain a lot of functions. Consider byte-compile
them.
*** TODO [#C] How to customize themes on earth?
Which one: ~set-face-attribute~, ~customize-set-faces~,
~customize-theme-set-faces~, ...
*** TODO [#C] Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes
doom-themes is a good place to develop other themes, but it makes the
customization more complex. Try to separate my color definitions from that, or
read and understand its source code.

Maybe this package is helpful: [[https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer][autothemer]]
*** CANCELED [#C] I have some extra functions in the ~:preface~ section for each package.
Autoload them.
*** DONE [#B] Package manager: Info doc?
See the documentation for ~Info-default-directory-list~ and
~Info-directory-list~.

TL;DR: add paths that contain Info documentations to ~Info-default-directory-list~.

- [X] Add Magit's Info path. See it's README.org.
- [X] Add org-roam's
- [X] Generalize the interface to manage Info docs of packages.
*** DONE [#B] [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-07-16-emacs-focused-editing/][Prot's focused editing]] (zen-mode)
[[https://github.com/larstvei/Focus.git][Focus]]: dim the surrounding paragraphs, the idea is pretty, but not necessary.
*** DONE [#B] Tweaks emacs-everywhere for perspective.el
If I still want to keep emacs-everywhere. The two do not cooperate well. When
persp.el is enabled, the transient buffer created by emacs-everywhere cannot be
killed properly, and a confirmation always pops out to ask "whether to kill the
unsaved buffer anyway", which is annoying.

I've dropped perspective.el, it's so buggy (f60da965c338405cef6ea379e4d7fc2c7ad526d5).
I hate it.
*** DONE [#C] Refactor dependencies, absorb =init-package.el=.
*** DONE [#C] Learn about how popper.el works. Tweaks ~display-buffer~.
Popper.el does a good job in protecting my window layout. However some plugins
are special: org-agenda, gptel, ... They still destroy my window layout, which
makes me annoying.

Maybe I also need to learn more about window.el.

2024-05-06: It seems that popper works by modifying ~display-buffer-alist~.

2024-05-18: Micky's article needs to be investigated more.

2024-05-21: popper.el is completely dropped.

- [X] Read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/179t67l/window_management_share_your_displaybufferalist/][this thread]], which discusses the customization of this variable.
- [X] I just find [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-UIzYPn38s][Prot's video about this]].
*** DONE [#C] Deprecate ~celeste/use-package~.
This macro just add a default ~:load-path~. It's unnecessary, and is not
elegant, make my configurations difficult to copy.
Just remove it, and add a new macro/function to add something to ~load-path~.

2024-05-13: I'm almost here. New macros ~celeste/prepare-package~ and
~celeste/prepare-package-2~ are added.

- [X] totally remove ~celeste/use-pacakge~.
** FIXME
:PROPERTIES:
:VISIBILITY: content
:END:
*** TODO [#A] treesitter integration: major mode shortcuts are not inherited
For example, in ~yaml-ts-mode~, ~yaml-electric-backspace~ isn't bound to DEL.
*** TODO [#A] there is always an empty line in ~consult-yank-pop~
It appears as the first condidate, which is annoying. Is this a kill-ring bug?
*** TODO [#A] Rescue my LogSeq Notes 😭
A good way to convert logseq markdown to org:

1. mldoc convert -i ./Makefile.md -o ./Makefile.html
2. search all list-related element tags like <li> and </li>, delete them
3. pandoc -f html -t org -o ./Makefile.org ./Makefile.html
*** TODO [#B] Consult and tab-bar and dedicated window
Buffer with dedicated window should always be listed in ~consult-buffer-filter~,
otherwise, when consulting buffers, the selected window will change
unpredictably, which will ruin the window configuration.
*** TODO [#B] Errors in ~vertico--exhibit~
Reproduction: enter org-mode, ~C-c / m~ then ~M-p~.
*** TODO [#B] Enable annotation match in ~insert-char~
Customize orderless, such as:

*** TODO [#B] ~C-g~ Behavior
It may be caused by sis.
*** TODO [#C] Emacs-Everywhere problem
Cannot convert org to markdown.
*** TODO [#C] When vertico is invoked, the fringe of some buffers shrink
When the line number >= 100 (maybe), the buffer would move.

*** TODO [#C] vertico-posframe display bug
If the variable ~vertico-posframe-parameters~ is set and then use
~global-text-scale-adjust~, the fringe will mask the vertico contents.

This bug may take me some time to figure out the reason since I'm unfamiliar
with posframe.

* Known Bugs

** Handling windows with popper and evil

How to reproduce: open Emacs, =C-h f= and then search for any callable
functions, open the help buffer (in popper window). Click any link that targets
to a file in the help buffer, the file appears at the right of the orginal
window. Then =C-w x= (~evil-window-exchange~), an error like this occurs:

#+begin_quote
Window #<window 7 on *helpful function: url-user*> has same side bottom as
window #<window 9 on *helpful function: url-user*> but no common parent
#+end_quote

- [X] [[https://github.com/akreisher/eshell-syntax-highlighting][eshell-syntax-highlighting]]

- [X] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]]: ~avy-goto-char-2~

- [X] ~celeste/require~: the first argument should be a symbol!

- [X] ~org-goto~ and ~evil-mode~. The command ~org-goto~ is convenient for
  navigating the org doc.

  It's solved by adding an advice around ~org-goto~
  (4deb7308d220a9af3800a130fa5724dabead5d98).

- [X] Also keep tramp remote files in recentf

  In fact, ~recentf-cleanup~ determines whether a file should be cleaned with
  ~recentf-keep-default-predicate~ by default, which also handles the case of
  remote files. Its source code is simple:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun recentf-keep-default-predicate (file)
    "Return non-nil if FILE should be kept in the recent list.
  It handles the case of remote files as well."
    (cond
     ((file-remote-p file nil t) (file-readable-p file))
     ((file-remote-p file))
     ((file-readable-p file))))
  #+end_src

  So it cleans remote files that are not readable.

  We can add regexps or predicates to ~recentf-keep~ to keep more files. For
  example, my "remote" files on my OrbStack virtual machine become unreadable
  when the virtual machine is turned down, so I add this configuration:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'recentf-keep "^/ssh:orb:")
  #+end_src

- [X] [[https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat/][eat]] VS [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]]

  Emacs-eat is a relatively-newer package that aims to provide experience much
  more like a terminal emulator with better integration with Emacs Lisp. The
  most attractive feature is the ~eshell-eat-mode~, which turns Eshell to a
  (semi-finished) terminal emulator, which provides the functionality like
  ~eshell-visual-command-mode~ without leaving the Eshell window.

  However, emacs-eat seems to be premature. It's still buggy, and I found no
  lucky when I try to integrate my Zsh with it.

  2024/04/23: Vterm is better.

- [X] Why is eshell loaded immediately after Emacs starts?

  ~emacs -q~ and ~emacs -Q~, then ~(featurep 'eshell)~ => nil

  Reason: the package exec-path-from-shell has ~require~-ed eshell.

- [X] Gradually get rid of evil...

- [X] multi-vterm

- [X] [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-hide-mode-line][hide-mode-line-mode]]

- [X] Customize org bold.

- [X] How to make =diff-hl= do not display staged parts?

- [X] auto kill buffers

  There is no need to implement such feature.

- [X] ~doom-modeline~ tweak. How can I persist some important information (such as
  org-clock) when the frame size is limited?

  I don't use doom-modeline anymore!

- [X] [[https://github.com/magit/forge.git][magit forge]]

- [X] [[https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti][olivetti]]: alternative for writeroom-mode

- [X] convert markdown-style link to org-style link.

- [X] Respect the true line numbers (folded lines also counts) in commands
  ~next-line~, ~previous-line~, ~evil-previous-line~, ~evil-next-line~, etc.

  These commands do not know if some regions are folded, which is prevalent in
  org-mode and markdown-mode.

  Solved: use ~previous-logical-line~ and ~next-logical-line~.

- [X] Package manager: autoload?

- [X] perspective.el + projectile.el => [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/tabspaces][mclear-tools/tabspaces]]

  These two seem to be buggy, at least I've gotten unlucky. And these two are
  old. Emacs has builtin project.el now, and perspective uses little new
  features.

  2024-05-08: tabspaces is buggy too :(
