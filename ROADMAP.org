*** TODO [#B] Confirm before kill scratch buffer
Customize ~kill-buffer-hook~.
*** TODO [#B] multi-vterm: dedicated window
*** TODO [#B] Disable mouse wheel
It's too annoying with my magical mouse.

On the tab:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(keymap-global-unset "<tab-bar> <wheel-up>" t)
(keymap-global-unset "<tab-bar> <wheel-down>" t)
#+end_src
*** TODO [#C] Special fonts in =*Messages*= buffer
*** TODO [#C] Is it necessary to specify fringe?
See [[elisp:(info "(elisp) Fringe Size/Pos")][manual]]. Related variables: ~{left,right}-fringe-width~, ~default-frame-alist~.
*** DOING [#A] ~whitespace-cleanup-mode~: do not clean newlines in the end
- [X] Implement in ~whitespace-cleanup-mode-write-file~
- [ ] ~whitespace-write-file-hook~ also remove the empty lines at the beginning
- [ ] Send a PR?
*** CANCELED [#B] It would be better if ~consult-buffer~'s posframe could be lower in the screen
2024-05-14: cancel. I do not use vertico-posframe anymore.
- [ ] ~consult-buffer~: lower
- [ ] ~yank-pop~ and ~consult-yank-pop~: even lower
*** DONE [#A] Set mark before ~avy-goto-char~
*** DONE [#A] Always backup input when ~C-c C-c~ in ~forge-create-pullreq~
*** DONE [#A] Upcase the region in ~upcase-previous-word~
*** DONE [#A] Rewrite ~celeste/sis-mode~
- ~sis-global-respect-mode~ should be buffer-local, since it overrides some
  prefix key, which conflicts with embark.

It's difficult to do that. So I write a convenient wrapper for sis, ~celeste/sis-mode~.

*** DONE [#A] Enable auto ~whitespace-cleanup~ for YAML file
*** DONE [#A] Disable bindings for ~C-<wheel-up>~ in OSX
My magical mouse is to sensitive.
*** DONE [#A] Enable more consult extensions like ~consult-info~
*** DONE [#A] customize ~org-ellipsis~
*** DONE [#A] bind ~multi-vterm~
*** DONE [#A] rename ~+org-kill-this-link~
Should be something like ~+org-cut-this-link~
*** DONE [#B] Write a function to insert info page as org-link
*** DONE [#B] Should I write a function like "always-save"?
I add it.
*** DONE [#B] Add warning facility for ~celeste/prepare-package~
*** DONE [#B] Embark and helpful integration
*** DONE [#B] Remove ~diff-hl-\*~ bindings. They are useless and buggy. Just use Magit.

combobulate is powered Tree-Sitter

[[https://emacs-china.org/t/puni/18101][Puni: 通用、可定制的语法删除 - Emacs-general - Emacs China]]

2024-05-25: I just find puni might also be a good choice for sturctured editing.

*** TODO [#B] How to format org?
For example, from
#+begin_quote

*** DOING [#A] electric (builtin) VS [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens.git][smartparens]]

Problems of ~electric-pair-mode~ I found:
- It pairs '<' and '>' in org-mode. But I sometimes use ~->~, which breaks the
  following pairing: insert a left parenthesis do not insert the right part
  automatically. _This is because electric try to pair ">" in the src block!_

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(<> (minibuffer-depth) 0) ; remove the less than sign, horrible thing happen!
#+end_src

*** DOING [#A] Configure Eglot

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/tqi0zc/lspmode_vs_eglot/][This thread]] provides some information I care about:
- Eglot is an Out-Of-Box LSP client that "just works"
- Eglot now works perfectly with corfu and orderless

I also find [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] is
- Built-in since Emacs 29!
- Integrated seamlessly with flymake, eldoc, xref, project. Really!
- Very easy to setup, compared to lsp-bridge
- Not so slow as I thought before
- I can use ~completion-at-point~ now. The ecosystem is never limited.

Step:
- [ ] [[https://github.com/nemethf/eglot-x][eglot-x]] for unofficial LSP extensions
- [ ] tempel and eglot: [[https://github.com/fejfighter/eglot-tempel][eglot-tempel]], [[https://github.com/minad/tempel/issues/103#issuecomment-1544323744][tempel#103]]
- [X] [[https://andreyor.st/posts/2023-09-09-migrating-from-lsp-mode-to-eglot/][This blog]], thought the author himself did not use Eglot anymore
  (2024-05-25, refered from his dotfiles).

*** DOING [#A] Rainbow indentation
python-mode, yaml-mode

- [ ] further customize [[https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides][highlight-indent-guides]]
*** DOING [#A] Improve reading UX
Set a new customizable variable ~celeste-reading-font-name~, which should be
set to a proportional font. It aims to be used in reading context.
Declare a minor mode ~celeste-reading-mode~.

- [X] [[https://emacs-china.org/t/topic/22639][【讨论】一种提升英文阅读体验的可能性]]

- [ ]  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font][Monospaced font - wikipedia]]
- [ ] Is it possible to change the minibuffer font individually?
*** PENDING [#C] [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]: is it stabler than lsp-bridge?
I just find Eglot really nice.

[[https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/emacs/init.el][Andrey Listopadov's init.el]] that uses corfu and lsp-mode simultaneously.
*** PENDING [#C] [[https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework][EAF]] - Maybe I will try it again once I switch to a Linux distro.
*** CANCELED [#A] cnfont settings
[[https://github.com/tumashu/cnfonts.git][chfonts]]：实现中文字体和英文字体等宽

2024-05-15: not as helpful as I think it would be.
*** CANCELED [#B] [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][leuven]]: Best org-mode theme?
Average.
*** CANCELED [#C] Maybe it's time to try another theme
Candidates: [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs.git][tao-theme]] [[https://github.com/maio/eink-emacs][elink]]
Maintaining the theme by myself is difficult for me. I do not understand what a
theme does under the hood. It may be better to begin with other people's work.

Doom's themes are too magical. My theme is based on doom-themes but I really
want to separate it out.

2024-05-12: I'm not satisfied with those themes. Maybe I still need to customize
my own theme. But I need to get rid of doom-themes. See [[*Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes][Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes]].
*** DONE [#A] new auto-save facility
Fork [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/auto-save][lazycat's auto-save]]
*** DONE [#A] shellcheck integration
Already integrated by flycheck.
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]], [[https://github.com/Ladicle/hydra-posframe][hydra-posframe]], [[https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el][pretty-hydra]]
2024-05-13: Hydra is added. I may not use pretty-hydra or hydra-posframe. I want
to keep my hydra configuration simple enough: it should not conquer my key
binding system - it should just be a kind of sugar that brings some facilities
to me.

- [X] org-mode navigation hydra. Better than ~org-speed-command~.
- [X] add more navigation commands in hydra-vi. Ref: [[file:packages/hydra/hydra-examples.el::defhydra hydra-vi (:pre hydra-vi/pre :post hydra-vi/post :color amaranth][hydra-example.el: hydra-vi]]
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/mickeynp/ligature.el][ligature.el]]

*** DONE [#A] Add ~project-vterm~ to project's shortcut
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/tecosaur/org-pandoc-import][org-pandoc-import]]: how did you come with that
It's Okay, but I would prefer to use it just as the a pandoc frontend. The
~org-pandoc-import-transient-mode~ seems to be buggy for me.
*** DONE [#A] org-mode (use the newest version)
*** DONE [#A] [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/gcmh][gcmh]]: GC magic hack

Related thread: [[https://emacs-china.org/t/topic/18006][一个支持多词典的翻译插件(目前仅支持单词) - Emacs-general - Emacs China]]

Currently OK, with osx-dictionary.
*** DONE [#B] protect ~tab-bar-close-tab~
It's easy to be mispressed.
- [X] remove the binding
- [X] add confirmation mechanism
- [X] restore the binding
*** DONE [#B] purcell's [[https://github.com/purcell/whitespace-cleanup-mode.git][whitespace-cleanup-mode]]
*** DONE [#B] [[https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el][devdocs.el]]
*** DONE [#B] Exclude useless buffers like "Helpful" buffer
*** DONE [#C] [[https://github.com/roife/emt][emt]]: 中文分词，基于 macOS 自带的分词系统
*** DONE [#C] [[https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar][pulsar]]: pulse the current line after running select functions.
Really good.
*** DONE [#C] [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/undo-tree/blob/master/undo-tree.el][undo-tree]] or [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/undo-fu-session][undo-fu-session]]

*** TODO [#A] Write scripts to compile packages
Some packages can be compiled into byte-code. Docs can be installed too.
*** TODO [#B] Try to report the "bug" of ~kill-whole-line~
To report a bug of Emacs, use ~report-emacs-bug~ and send an Email. Before that,
I want to set the Email client in Emacs, and subscribe Emacs's mailing list.
*** TODO [#B] Improve [[file:lisp/init-org.el::defun +org-sort-todo-with-priority (][+org-sort-todo-with-priority]]
Specify the order, e.g. the priority of DOING should be over TODO.
*** TODO [#B] ~consult-locate~ for OSX
OSX use ~mdfind~ for locate command. It behaves differently from locate.
I may need something like:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq consult-locate-args "mdfind-wrapper -name ARG OPTS")
#+end_src
*** TODO [#C] Better (or more suitable for me) LSP client?
- [ ] Reddit thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1c0v28k/lspmode_vs_lspbridge_vs_lspce_vs_eglot/][I used all the LSP thingies so you don't have to.]]
*** TODO [#C] Manage byte compiler
Some packages like org-roam contain a lot of functions. Consider byte-compile
them.
*** TODO [#C] How to customize themes on earth?
Which one: ~set-face-attribute~, ~customize-set-faces~,
~customize-theme-set-faces~, ...
*** TODO [#C] Separate cobalt2 from doomemacs/themes
doom-themes is a good place to develop other themes, but it makes the
customization more complex. Try to separate my color definitions from that, or
read and understand its source code.

Maybe this package is helpful: [[https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer][autothemer]]
*** DOING [#B] Write +lsp-zero+ ide-zero macro
- [X] the basic feature
- [ ] add test with ERT
- [ ] enable lsp-bridge
*** DOING [#C] ~celeste/auto-save-mode~ performace issue
It's mainly caused by ~after-save-hook~. For example, org-roam buffers have a
function ~org-roam-db-autosync--setup-update-on-save-h~ in ~after-save-hook~,
which is very slow.

Currently I disable ~org-roam-db-autosync-mode~. However, other modes has their
interesting hooks too, for example ~wakatime-save~. I need to make auto-save
disable these hooks that should not be run so frequently.

Reduce the time to run ~after-save-hook~. *MUST DO*: run ~after-save-hook~ when
the buffer is killed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(advice-add #'kill-buffer :before
            (defun +kill-buffer-run-after-save-hook-a (&optional buf-or-name)
              (save-current-buffer
                (when buf-or-name (set-buffer buf-or-name))
                (run-hooks 'after-save-hook))))
#+end_src

Use a buffer-local counter? When a buffer is saved each X times, trigger the
~after-save-hook~. The problem: some hooks should be run immediately, such as
flycheck's.

*** CANCELED [#C] I have some extra functions in the ~:preface~ section for each package.
Autoload them.
*** DONE [#B] Package manager: Info doc?
See the documentation for ~Info-default-directory-list~ and
~Info-directory-list~.

TL;DR: add paths that contain Info documentations to ~Info-default-directory-list~.

- [X] Add Magit's Info path. See it's README.org.
- [X] Add org-roam's
- [X] Generalize the interface to manage Info docs of packages.
*** DONE [#B] [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-07-16-emacs-focused-editing/][Prot's focused editing]] (zen-mode)
[[https://github.com/larstvei/Focus.git][Focus]]: dim the surrounding paragraphs, the idea is pretty, but not necessary.
*** DONE [#B] Tweaks emacs-everywhere for perspective.el
If I still want to keep emacs-everywhere. The two do not cooperate well. When
persp.el is enabled, the transient buffer created by emacs-everywhere cannot be
killed properly, and a confirmation always pops out to ask "whether to kill the
unsaved buffer anyway", which is annoying.

I've dropped perspective.el, it's so buggy (f60da965c338405cef6ea379e4d7fc2c7ad526d5).
I hate it.
*** DONE [#C] Refactor dependencies, absorb =init-package.el=.
*** DONE [#C] Learn about how popper.el works. Tweaks ~display-buffer~.
Popper.el does a good job in protecting my window layout. However some plugins
are special: org-agenda, gptel, ... They still destroy my window layout, which
makes me annoying.

Maybe I also need to learn more about window.el.

2024-05-06: It seems that popper works by modifying ~display-buffer-alist~.

2024-05-18: Micky's article needs to be investigated more.

2024-05-21: popper.el is completely dropped.

- [X] Read [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager][Mickey's wonderful article on window management]].
- [X] Read [[elisp:(info "(emacs) Window Choice")][(emacs) Window Choice]].
- [X] Read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/179t67l/window_management_share_your_displaybufferalist/][this thread]], which discusses the customization of this variable.
- [X] I just find [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-UIzYPn38s][Prot's video about this]].
*** DONE [#C] Deprecate ~celeste/use-package~.
This macro just add a default ~:load-path~. It's unnecessary, and is not
elegant, make my configurations difficult to copy.
Just remove it, and add a new macro/function to add something to ~load-path~.

2024-05-13: I'm almost here. New macros ~celeste/prepare-package~ and
~celeste/prepare-package-2~ are added.

- [X] totally remove ~celeste/use-pacakge~.

* Known Bugs

** Handling windows with popper and evil

How to reproduce: open Emacs, =C-h f= and then search for any callable
functions, open the help buffer (in popper window). Click any link that targets
to a file in the help buffer, the file appears at the right of the orginal
window. Then =C-w x= (~evil-window-exchange~), an error like this occurs:

#+begin_quote
Window #<window 7 on *helpful function: url-user*> has same side bottom as
window #<window 9 on *helpful function: url-user*> but no common parent
#+end_quote
